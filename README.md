# Smart-Home-Automation
Smart Home Automation Using ATmega32, LCD, Temperature Sensor, LDR Sensor, Flame Sensor and Motor Control.
This project focuses on developing a smart home automation system that intelligently manages lighting, fan speed, and fire detection based on environmental conditions.

System Components:
ATmega32 Microcontroller – The core controller of the system.
LM35 Temperature Sensor – Monitors room temperature for fan speed adjustment.
LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) – Detects ambient light intensity for automated lighting control.
Flame Sensor – Identifies fire hazards and triggers safety alerts.
PWM-Controlled Motor – Regulates fan speed based on temperature variations.
LCD Display – Provides real-time system status updates.
H-Bridge Circuit – Controls the motor's direction and speed.
LED Indicators – Represent different light intensity levels.
Key Functionalities:
Automated Lighting: The system uses an LDR to assess ambient light levels and adjusts LED indicators accordingly.
Smart Fan Speed Control: The LM35 sensor dynamically regulates the fan’s speed in proportion to the detected temperature.
Fire Detection & Safety Alerts: A flame sensor detects potential fire hazards, activating an alarm and displaying an emergency alert on the LCD.
Real-Time Monitoring: The LCD screen displays live temperature readings, fan operation status, light intensity levels, and safety alerts.
This smart home system enhances convenience, energy efficiency, and safety by automating essential household functions based on real-time environmental data.
